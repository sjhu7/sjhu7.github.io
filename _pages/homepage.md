<p>
I am a Ph.D. student in the College of Civil Engineering at <a href="http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Hunan University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chao-Zhang-43" target="_blank">Chao Zhang</a>. I joined Zhang’s <a href="https://chaozhanghnu.github.io/" target="_blank">UNSAT Lab</a> in 2019 as a 3rd-year undergraduate student, and completed my B.S. degree in 2020. I am fortunate to continue my research here, and to collaborate closely with Prof. <a href="https://cee.mines.edu/project/lu-ning/" target="_blank">Ning Lu</a> from Colorado School of Mines.

<!-- <p>
My passion lies in various fascinating phase equilibrium and phase transition processes in porous media, particularly in soils, and their implications on poromechanics. I integrate cutting-edge insights from surface and interfacial science, multiscale experimental techniques, and molecular dynamics simulations to explore molecular-level mechanisms behind vapor sorption and capillary condensation, pore water freezing and melting, as well as pore salt deliquescence and efflorescence processes, and upscale their influences to develop poromechanics models.

My passion lies in various fascinating phase equilibrium and phase transition processes in porous media, particularly in soils, and their implications for poromechanics. 
Current research mainly focus on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vapor sorption and capillary condensation</li>
  <li>Pore water freezing and melting</li>
  <li>Pore salt deliquescence and efflorescence</li>
</ul>

<p>
I seek to understand how these pore-scale processes shape Earth and engineering systems at the large scale.

<p>
In UNSAT Lab, I belong to a group dedicated to phase change research. I also assist Prof. Zhang in managing this group and enjoy close collaboration with the members, who are the most incredible, talented, and beautiful partners ever.
